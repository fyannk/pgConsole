# Checks and playbooks

This page is generated from the diagnostics catalog by `make catalog-docs`
and kept equal to it by a test. It lists every check the console runs,
grouped by the layer of the stack it looks at, and every triage
playbook with the checks behind each of its steps. What a check
*means* — its four outcomes, how findings relate, what each kind of
evidence needs — is in the [diagnostics guide](../guides/diagnostics.md).

A check's **applies to** column is its version pin: on an observed
version outside it the check answers "does not apply". A check with
none applies everywhere. **Follows from** lists the checks the catalog
relates this one to as consequences of, with the relation's scope and
strength where they differ from *same cluster, established*.

142 checks: 136 catalog rules and 6 hand-written detectors.

## Declined upstream signals

Signals the verified operator releases can write that no check listens for, each with the reason. The coverage verification fails on a signal that is neither listened for nor listed here.

| Signal | Why no check |
|---|---|
| `BackupStarted` | a backup in progress is not a finding; cnpg-backup-stuck-pending reads the Backup's own phase and age |
| `BootstrapCompleted` | success |
| `BootstrapPending` | cnpg-bootstrap-stuck reads the phase and how long it has held, which the condition does not carry |
| `ClientSecretNotFound` | recorded on the plugin's Service in the operator's namespace |
| `Cluster in healthy state` | the healthy phase is the absence of a finding; the sidebar has no zero state for the same reason |
| `ClusterIsReady` | success; cnpg-not-ready reads the condition's False status |
| `ContinuousArchivingFailing` | cnpg-wal-archiving-failing reads the condition's False status, whose only reason this is |
| `ContinuousArchivingSuccess` | success |
| `DiscoverImage` | the same failure sets the image-catalog phase, which cnpg-image-catalog-unusable reads with the catalog checks beneath it |
| `Failing over` | read through currentPrimary and targetPrimary by cnpg-primary-move-stuck, which also knows how long the move has taken |
| `FinalizerRemovalFailed` | recorded on the plugin's Service in the operator's namespace |
| `FindingCluster` | a Backup naming a Cluster the operator cannot find is not a member of this cluster's catalog, so its events are never attributed here |
| `InvalidClientCertificate` | recorded on the plugin's Service in the operator's namespace |
| `InvalidPortAnnotation` | recorded on the plugin's Service in the operator's namespace |
| `InvalidServerCertificate` | recorded on the plugin's Service in the operator's namespace |
| `PluginRegistrationFailed` | recorded on the plugin's Service in the operator's namespace |
| `ServerSecretNotFound` | recorded on the plugin's Service in the operator's namespace |
| `Switchover in progress` | read through currentPrimary and targetPrimary by cnpg-primary-move-stuck, which also knows how long the move has taken |
| `active` | success |

## Triage playbooks

Each step is answered by the checks named beside it; a step with no checks is a question for the reader.

5. **What does the object store itself hold?** — `barman-no-successful-backup`, `barman-last-backup-failed`, `repository-wal-unhealthy`, `repository-coverage-unhealthy`, `repository-retention-unhealthy`, `cnpg-retention-failed`

### The cluster will not come up

a new cluster, or a recreated instance, never becomes healthy.

1. **Has the operator refused the definition, or stopped before starting?** — fact: the API server reports no Cluster object of this name — `cnpg-invalid-definition`, `cnpg-unrecoverable`, `cnpg-cannot-create-objects`, `cnpg-unknown-plugin`, `cnpg-plugin-failure`, `cnpg-image-catalog-unusable`, `cnpg-image-catalog-missing`, `cnpg-image-catalog-lacks-major`, `cnpg-service-account-missing` — or run `kubectl -n <namespace> get cluster <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}: {.status.phaseReason}'`

4. **Can the operator reach the instances it created?** — `cnpg-status-unreachable`, `cnpg-liveness-isolation`, `cnpg-no-system-id`, `cnpg-not-ready` — or run `kubectl -n cnpg-system logs deployment/cnpg-controller-manager | grep 'Cannot extract Pod status'`
5. **Is the data directory itself usable?** — `cnpg-pvc-unusable`, `cnpg-pvc-dangling`, `cnpg-pg-control-lost`, `cnpg-pg-rewind-failed`

### A replica is behind or not replicating

a standby lags, is out of the read service, or is on the wrong timeline.

1. **Is the replica streaming at all?** — `cnpg-replica-not-streaming`, `cnpg-replica-not-receiving`, `cnpg-replica-lagging`, `cnpg-replication-lag-high` — or run `kubectl cnpg status <name> --verbose`

5. **Is a replica-cluster promotion or demotion in progress?** — `cnpg-promotion-stuck`, `cnpg-replica-switch-stuck`, `cnpg-demotion-fencing`

### The operator seems to be doing nothing

a change to the Cluster has no effect, or the status stops moving.

1. **Has the operator been told to wait, or to stop?** — `cnpg-hibernated`, `cnpg-waiting-for-user`, `cnpg-upgrade-delayed`, `cnpg-hibernation-blocked` — or run `kubectl -n <namespace> get cluster <name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations}'`

5. **Has the operator stopped renewing what it manages?** — `cnpg-certificate-expired`, `cnpg-certificate-expiring`, `cnpg-not-ready`, `cnpg-rollout-stuck`
6. **Is the operator itself running?** — or run `kubectl -n cnpg-system get pods && kubectl -n cnpg-system describe deployment cnpg-controller-manager`
