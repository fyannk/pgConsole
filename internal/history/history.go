// Package history retains a bounded, in-memory revision timeline of the
// watched Kubernetes object definitions: what changed, when it was
// observed, and by which field manager. It is pure domain, like observe:
// it imports neither client-go nor the CloudNativePG API types. The kube
// boundary hands it source-neutral observations whose manifests are
// already normalized and scrubbed; this package classifies, deduplicates,
// coalesces and bounds them.
//
// Everything here is Kubernetes-reported and says so: a revision records
// what the API server delivered and when this process observed it, never
// when the change happened. Windows in which the process was not watching
// are explicit records, not silent continuity.
