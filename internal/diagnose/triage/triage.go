// Package triage walks a cluster's diagnostics from the symptom an
// operator arrives with, rather than from whatever happened to match.
//
// The diagnostics screen answers "what matched"; it is signal-driven,
// and an operator whose cluster refuses connections still has to find
// the finding that explains it among the others, or notice that none
// does. A playbook is the other direction: one symptom, an ordered list
// of questions in the order the upstream troubleshooting guide asks
// them, and each question answered by the checks that already ran —
// never by a check of its own. A playbook adds no observation and no
// judgement to the catalog; it is a reading order over it, written as
// data, so the two can never disagree about a fact.
//
// Every step answers one of five ways, and the honesty rules of the
// catalog carry through unchanged: a step is found when a check behind
// it matched, ruled out when every check behind it ran and cleared,
// unknown when one could not run, and switched off or inapplicable
// when the checks behind it were. A step with nothing behind it — a
// question the console cannot observe, such as a NetworkPolicy — says
// so and hands the reader the command that would answer it.
