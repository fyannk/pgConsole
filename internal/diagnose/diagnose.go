// Package diagnose correlates facts the other screens already carry into
// findings: statements about what is wrong and where, each anchored to
// the claim it rests on.
//
// It observes nothing of its own. Every detector is a pure function from
// already-published snapshots to findings, which is what keeps the whole
// package hermetically testable and keeps the screen inside the
// snapshot-first rule — no detector may reach the API server.
//
// The honesty rules the rest of the console follows apply here with more
// force, because a finding is the one thing on the site that is
// application-derived rather than reported:
//
//   - A finding restates and correlates. It never concludes something no
//     source reports.
//   - Every finding carries its evidence verbatim, with the origin of
//     that evidence named.
//   - A detector that cannot read its inputs says so. It never reports
//     "nothing wrong" from missing data, which is why Run returns what it
//     checked alongside what it found: an empty finding list means no
//     detector matched, never that the cluster is healthy.
