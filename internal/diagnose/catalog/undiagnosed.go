package catalog

// Undiagnosed is the catalog's list of upstream signals it has read and
// decided not to listen for, each with the reason. It exists so that
// ignoring a signal is a decision on record rather than an omission:
// the coverage verification (make verify-pins) fails on any phase,
// condition reason, backup or pooler phase, or Warning event reason in
// the verified releases that neither a rule listens for nor this list
// declines, and on an entry here that upstream no longer says or that
// a rule has since started listening for.
