// Package catalog is the declarative half of diagnostics: the rules,
// grouped by component. Small components keep a file here; large ones
// grow a package of their own, like cnpg, and are aggregated by Rules.
//
// The framework — the Rule shape, the conditions, the version gating —
// lives in the diagnose package; this tree holds only claims. Adding a
// diagnostic means adding a Rule to its component's file: declare the
// version pins the claim was verified against, the observation (a log
// line, an event, a condition, a phase, a metric flag, a backup phase),
// and the finding it means. A rule earns its place by catching
// something no hand-written detector already reports, and a log rule by
// naming a failure that appears in no object status at all.
