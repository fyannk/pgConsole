// Every snapshot a check reads carries its own staleness: the collector
// lost contact, and what it holds is the retained last-good observation.
// Stale data is fine to display with its age beside it. It is not fine
// to clear a check with, because "nothing matched in what was last seen"
// is not "nothing is wrong now" — and a match found in it is a claim
// about the past dressed as the present. So a stale source reads as
// unavailable, exactly as an unobserved one does, and the check says
// which of the two it was.
//
// Each source answers the question once, here, so a condition and a
// hand-written detector reading the same snapshot refuse it for the same
// reason. A new condition over one of these sources starts with the
// matching helper; a condition over a new source adds one.

// A check that could not run has two quite different reasons for it, and
// the screen has to tell them apart or neither gets read.
//
// A source can be switched off — log following, the object timeline, the
// scrapers, the repository-evidence consumer are all deliberate choices,
// and a deployment that has not made them is not faulty. Those reasons
// are permanent, identical on every refresh, and there is nothing to
// react to: they are a decision to make once.
//
// Or a source that is on can fail to answer: contact lost, nothing
// observed yet, a sweep that stopped. That is a fault, it is new, and it
// is the reason an operator needs to see now.
//
// Rendering both as one list of "could not run" buries the second in the
// first, on every screen of every healthy cluster. So the reasons for
// the first kind are named here as constants, returned by the helpers
// below and recognised by sourceOff — producer and classifier sharing
// one string, so they cannot drift apart. A reason nobody declared reads
// as a fault, which is the safe direction to be wrong in: an unread
// notice is better than a hidden failure.
