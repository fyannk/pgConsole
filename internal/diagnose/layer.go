// Layer is where in the stack a check looks: the answer to "which side
// is it" that an operator asks before "what is it". It is coarser than
// Component and cuts across it — a CloudNativePG rule about replication
// lag and a PostgreSQL rule about a long transaction are both about the
// database layer's health, while a CloudNativePG rule about a phase is
// about the operator's. Every check declares one, so the screen can
// fold the run into one line per layer without guessing from names.
