// The conditions here read the object timeline, which is the one input
// that carries the past rather than the present. Everything else the
// engine reads is a current snapshot, so a state that is wrong only
// because it keeps happening — a pod replaced over and over, a
// definition rewritten by two controllers in turn — is invisible to
// every other check. Nothing here needs state of its own: the store
// already retains the timeline, and a run just counts what is in it.
//
// Two properties of that store shape every claim made from it. It
// coalesces consecutive status transitions of one object inside a
// window, and it evicts old revisions to stay inside its bounds. Both
// mean a count taken from it is a floor: the timeline can under-report
// what happened and never over-report it. So a match here is sound, and
// an absence rules nothing out — the same footing as the log checks,
// and every rule built on these conditions says so.

// objectKey identifies one object across its incarnations: everything
// that makes it that object except the identity a replacement changes.
// Grouping by name alone would merge objects that merely share a name —
// a Pooler and the Service the operator names after it — into one
// inflated count, so the whole coordinate is the key and the UID
// deliberately is not part of it.
