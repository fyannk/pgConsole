// PodSubject is how reliably a condition names the pod its findings are
// about. It exists because a pod-scoped relation asks that of both ends:
// Relation.Holds refuses the pair unless each side names a pod, so a
// relation written against a cause that never names one can never hold,
// and would sit in the catalog looking like a claim while doing nothing.
//
// The three states are needed because the honest answer is not a
// boolean. A log match is always about the container that wrote the
// line; a cluster phase is never about a pod; an event is about whatever
// object Kubernetes recorded it on, which is sometimes a pod and
// sometimes the Cluster.

	// test refuses the relation and someone has to look — which is the

	// condition that does name a pod trips that test the first time a
	// relation points at it, and adding it to PodSubjectOf is the fix.
