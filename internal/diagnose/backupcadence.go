// one field short. Add the field they did not know about and the
// expression becomes 0 2 * * * *, which is valid, passes the operator's
// validation, and means every hour at two minutes past.
//
// Nothing then looks wrong. The cluster is healthy, backups are
// succeeding, and a terabyte-scale base backup is running twenty-four
// times a day, burning storage, egress and IO continuously until someone
// reads the bill. That is why this finding is the one exception to the
// screen's neutral register: everything else here describes something
// already visibly broken, and this describes something working exactly as
