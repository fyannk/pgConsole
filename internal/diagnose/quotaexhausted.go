// quotaExhaustedDetector reports a namespace ResourceQuota whose usage
// has reached its ceiling. This is the cause half of the quota story:
// the event-backed resource-quota detector quotes a refusal after it
// happened, and the scheduling detector shows the pod stuck on the
// object that could not be created — but neither can name the quota,
// its ceiling, or its usage. This one can, because the quota itself is
// observed.
//
// An exhausted quota with everything running is capacity, not damage,
// so the base severity is a warning. It escalates to critical when the
// cluster is visibly short of its declared instances at the same time:
// the two facts together are the refusal in progress.
