// Package logstream follows the member pods' container logs continuously
// and offers each line to sinks that decide what, if anything, to keep.
//
// It exists because two things the console needs are only in the logs:
// the operator writes some refusals nowhere else, and a container that
// has died takes its explanation with it.
//
// The design point is that the two consumers keep very different amounts:
//
//   - The matcher analyses each line once and keeps only what matched —
//     a bounded set of observations. Its memory does not grow with log
//     volume, so it is on whenever streaming is.
//   - The buffer keeps recent lines verbatim so a screen can show them.
//     That is a standing corpus of log text, which for PostgreSQL can
//     include statements and their literal values, so it is off by
//     default and bounded in bytes rather than lines.
//
// Everything here is best effort and says so. A follow stream drops
// lines across reconnects, rotation, and container restarts, and
// Kubernetes offers no way to detect what was missed. A gap is therefore
// recorded as an explicit marker rather than papered over, and nothing
// in this package reports a count as though it were complete.
